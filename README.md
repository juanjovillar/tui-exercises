# TUI assessmnent

## 01 Flight Assistant
In the implementation I have tried to cover different aspects of:
- DDD
- CQRS
- Clean Arquitecture
- Desing Patterns
- Unit Testing

Is obviously overkill for the proposed problem and has been implemented in this way only for practice and demostration purposes. The UI implementation is minimal to be able to test the backend implementation

The thecnologies used are:
   - ASP.net Core MVC 2.1 (As required)
   - Entity Framework Core 2.1 (InMemory provider, persistence exists only during execution of the application)
   - Xunit and Moq for Unit Testing
   - ASP.net Razor Views scaffolding
